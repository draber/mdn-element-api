{"name":"spacer","status":"deprecated","summary":"The `<spacer>` HTML element is an obsolete HTML element which allowed insertion of empty spaces on pages. It was devised by Netscape to accomplish the same effect as a single-pixel layout image, which was something web designers used to use to add white spaces to web pages without actually using an image. However, `<spacer>` no longer supported by any major browser and the same effects can now be achieved using simple CSS.","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/spacer","type":"element","scope":"HTML","tags":["HTML"],"interfaces":["HTMLUnknownElement","HTMLElement","Element"],"namespace":"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml","contentCategories":"","permittedContent":"","tagOmission":"","permittedParents":"","implicitAriaRole":"","permittedAriaRoles":"","globalAttributes":"https://mdn-element-api.netlify.com/html/_global-attributes.json","attributes":{}}

{"name":"mmultiscripts","status":"living","summary":"The MathML `<mmultiscripts>` element allows you to create tensor-like objects. In a descriptive way tensors are multidimensional matrices (mathematical imprecise but exemplified). The degree of a tensor depends on the dimensionality of a representative array. For example, a number is a 0-dimensional array, or a 0th-order tensor. A 1-dimensional array (e.g. vectors) is a 1st-order tensor and so 2nd-order tensors are needed to represent square matrices. To learn more about the mathematical background of tensors refer to the entry on Wikipedia.","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Element/mmultiscripts","type":"element","scope":"MathML","tags":["MathML","MathML Reference","MathML Element","MathML Script and Limit Schemata"],"interfaces":["MathMLElement","Element"],"namespace":"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML","contentCategories":"","permittedContent":"","tagOmission":"","permittedParents":"","implicitAriaRole":"","permittedAriaRoles":"","globalAttributes":"https://mdn-element-api.netlify.com/mathml/_global-attributes.json","attributes":{"class":{"name":"class","status":"living","summary":"Provided for use with stylesheets.","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Element/mmultiscripts","type":"attribute","scope":"MathML:mmultiscripts","tags":[]},"id":{"name":"id","status":"living","summary":"Provided for use with stylesheets.","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Element/mmultiscripts","type":"attribute","scope":"MathML:mmultiscripts","tags":[]},"style":{"name":"style","status":"living","summary":"Provided for use with stylesheets.","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Element/mmultiscripts","type":"attribute","scope":"MathML:mmultiscripts","tags":[]},"displaystyle":{"name":"displaystyle","status":"living","summary":"A Boolean value specifying whether more vertical space is used for displayed equations or, if set to `false`, a more compact layout is used to display formulas.
